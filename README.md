# FilmQueryProject


##Description
Do you every find yourself trying to remember the name of a movie that you want to watch,
 but you only remember a few words of the title or description?
 
Do you want a way to find the movie name that's at the tip of your tongue? 


Welcome to FilmIt!

At FilmIt, only a word is needed to give you a list of possible movie titles that you're searching for. 

When the movies are listed, we give you a few more items to help jog your memory, such as the release year, actors, and a description. 

We want to make it as easy as possible to help you the movie you're looking for!

##Technologies Used
* Tutorials Point, Java Docs, AVAJAVA, stack Overflow, Google, PatorJK (asciiArt)  
* GitHub, Eclipse, SQL, Maven, JDBC, MAMP

##Lessons Learned
**The hardest part of creating a program from a few sentences is that I tend to over-complicate the simple. 
I tried to incorporate a few "if" conditions to display the language of the film and after a few trials and errors, I asked for help. 
Only to realize that I was going to far to get a simple word that was already in the database and I only had to pull that word using the same sequence of events that I used to pull the rest of the data from the database.


##Difficulties Experienced

My biggest difficulty was attempting to create multiple "if" statements in my getter, but not having it work. 

##Enjoyable Moments

The most enjoyable part of my project is, of course, watching my program working cleanly, but also utilizing ASCII art in my program. The menu portion is always my favorite part of my projects when I learned how to properly use "switch" cases.
